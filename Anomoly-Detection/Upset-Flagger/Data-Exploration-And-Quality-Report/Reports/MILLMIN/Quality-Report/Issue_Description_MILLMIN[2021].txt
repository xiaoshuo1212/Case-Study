Missing issue: the %Miss. column of the data quality report shows that  are the features with an obvious problem with missing values with missing percentage of  respectively
Cardinality issue:  reading down the Card. column of the data quality report, we can see that many of the continuous features in the dataset also have very low cardinality values, the tops are P300_PROD_FROTH_OSG_MIN_PCT, P300_L15_TAILS_QB_BIT_PCT, P300_L16_TAILS_QB_BIT_PCT, P300_L17_TAILS_QB_BIT_PCT whose cardinality account for only 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01 of overall data respectively.The low cardinality for those features should be investigated with the business to see if they are invalid, or they might only take values in a small range.
Outlier Issue: from an examination of the minimum and maximum values for each continuous feature,P86_FROTH_MINERAL, MILL_FROTH_PROD, MILL_OILSAND_MASS, 82WC199, 82WC299, 82DI716, 82DI746, 82DI776, P85_OPPA_FINES_30M, P85_OPPB_FINES_30M, P85_OPPC_FINES_30M, 85AI110, P85_OPPA_D50_30M, P85_OPPB_D50_30M, P85_OPPC_D50_30M, P85_OPPA_MB_30M, P85_OPPB_MB_30M, P85_OPPC_MB_30M, P85_OPPA_BPT_30M, P85_OPPB_BPT_30M, P85_OPPC_BPT_30M, 85DI2661, 85DI3661, 86TI168, 86TI188, 86TIC209, 86TIC309, MM_ORE_BPT_30M, MM_ORE_D50_30M, MM_ORE_FINES_30M, MM_ORE_MB_30M, P85_OPPA_CL, P85_OPPB_CL, P85_OPPC_CL, 86II252, 86II255, 86II275, 85WIC1703, P86_L12_TAILS_BIT_PCT, P86_L13_TAILS_BIT_PCT, P86_L14_TAILS_BIT_PCT, 86FIC453 jumps out as having an unusual maximum value.
